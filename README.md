# LANDSET LENS - NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024  (Team Paragon)

## Landsat Reflectance Data on the Fly and at Your Fingertips

### Project Overview

Welcome to Team PARAGON's solution for the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge! Our project provides a powerful and user-friendly platform for accessing real-time Landsat satellite data, specifically from Landsat 8 and 9, using an interactive interface that simplifies the process of retrieving, processing, and analyzing satellite imagery.

### Challenge Overview

We are addressing the challenge of **comparing ground-based spectral measurements** with **Landsat Surface Reflectance (SR) data**. This task is often complex, labor-intensive, and not integrated into a single cohesive application. 

Some key difficulties we solve include:

- The overwhelming volume of data generated by Landsat satellites, making data management difficult.
- Variations in image quality due to cloud cover, atmospheric conditions, and sensor calibration.
- Time-consuming data access and processing, often requiring specialized knowledge.

Our solution bridges these gaps by providing a streamlined, interactive platform to process, access, and visualize Landsat data along with ground-based measurements, easing the burden on users.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Satellite Tracking**: Visualize the paths and positions of Landsat 8 and 9 satellites in real-time on an interactive map.
  
- **Next Acquisition Date Calculation**: Easily calculate the next acquisition date for a specific location for both Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 satellites.

- **Landsat Reflectance Data**: Access real Landsat data for specific geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude) and view it as an image overlay on the map.

- **Interactive Map**: Use Leaflet and ESRI Leaflet to interactively explore geographical data, track satellites, and view data overlays.

- **Filter Controls**: Use controls like cloud percentage filters, date range selection, and more to refine the Landsat data results.

- **Email Reminder Feature**: Set reminders to receive email notifications when the next satellite pass is approaching your location.

### Technologies Used

#### Frontend

- **React**: Modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Leaflet**: JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **ESRI Leaflet**: Extends Leaflet with ArcGIS services and data.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript for type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Firebase**: Used for authentication and email reminders.

#### Backend

- **Python (Flask)**: Lightweight web framework for serving the backend.
- **Skyfield**: Library for satellite position calculations based on TLE data.
- **USGS Machine-to-Machine (M2M) API**: Used for searching and retrieving Landsat satellite data.
- **NASA Celestrak TLE API**: To retrieve up-to-date Two-Line Element (TLE) data for satellite tracking.

#### APIs & Services

- **USGS M2M API**: Used for fetching Landsat satellite imagery based on user input.
- **NASA Celestrak**: Provides the Two-Line Element (TLE) data for tracking satellites.
- **Landsat Track Metadata API**: For fetching metadata on satellite paths.
- **Firebase**: Used for user authentication and email reminders.


### User Features

#### Satellite Tracking
- Track the real-time positions of **Landsat 8** and **Landsat 9** on an interactive map.
- Click on any location to see the next acquisition date for that location.

#### Next Acquisition Date
- The application uses satellite orbit data and acquisition cycles to calculate the next time a satellite will pass over a specific location.
  
#### Viewing Landsat Data
- View reflectance data for any selected location.
- Use filter controls like cloud percentage and date range selection to refine results.
- Satellite images are shown as overlays on the map to analyze geographical changes.

#### Set Email Reminders
- Users can enable notifications for specific locations to be reminded via email before the next satellite pass.

### Future Enhancements

- **Ground-Based Measurements Integration**: We plan to streamline ground-based spectral measurements from [soilspectroscopy.org](https://soilspectroscopy.org) into the web application, allowing for more detailed comparative analysis with Landsat data.

- **Enhanced Analytics**: In future iterations, we aim to include in-depth analytics, such as vegetation index and surface temperature analysis using Landsat data.
